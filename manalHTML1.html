            <p>
                Once upon a night, I heard little meows underneath my kitchen's balcony, so I checked it out,and there appeared <i>4 little adorable kittens</i>.One was black, one was blonde and two were grey.

            <h3 style="color:purple;text-align:center;">Poor kittens</h3> 
            <p>I kept checking up on them,but after few days, they seemed to be getting weak and hungry. I was sure something happened to their mother and <b>they became on their own</b>. So, I bought a pet nursing bottle an some lactose free milk, and started looking after them.
            <br>
            Unfortunately only 2 kittens survived: <strong>Fluffy and Grumpy</strong>, meet them.
